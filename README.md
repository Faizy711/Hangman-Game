Deployment Date: Jan 27, 2018

# Purpose
\
The 3rd Homework assignment for the Northwestern Coding Bootcamp. A fun hangman game to understand how to run an app in a browser that features dynamically HTML and CSS code powered by Javascript. For this assignment I took some creative liberties and created a Nintedo Hangman game based on well know Nintendo characters. I also added some silly music and responsive sound effects to a right or wrong letter. Visit the page or clone the repository.

# Instruction
\
To clone the respository by copying the link or downloading

```
git clone
```
or go to <a href="https://faizy711.github.io/Hangman-Game/" target="_blank">Nintendo Hangman</a>.

Once at the page click on any of the letter on your key board and start playing. Once you win an alert will pop up or if you lose. Have fune!

# Built Using 

\
HTML\
CSS\
Javascript

# IceBox

\Several bugs need fixing

1) Word does not finish when you win, showing you the winning word.
2) Hangman last death does not show when lose.

Possible solutions maybe using a modal.
